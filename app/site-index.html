        <p>The trails are well drained and suitable for riding when wet. This is just a brute of a climb. The trail tread is mostly packed dirt mixed with rocks. It's fire road the entire way, absolutely zero singletrack. The objectives of this project are to promote mountain biking by creating a progressive trail that can be enjoyed by riders of all ages and ability level, and to increase the diversity of riding opportunities, demonstrate innovative and sustainable trail building design and techniques, and provide a model for other land managers for similar types of projects.
